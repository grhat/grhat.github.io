            <h2>Week 2</h2>
            <p>
                <span>I</span>n Ulises Carrión’s “Mail Art and the Big Monster,” Carrión proposes that mail art is a practice that considers the distribution of an artwork to be an integral aspect of shaping the message that the artwork conveys. For instance, one argument that stood out to me is how mail has historically been considered an easy, cheap, unpretentious, and democratic system of communication. However, with mail art, these generalizations cannot necessarily be made because they depend upon the artist and the artwork. Furthermore, there are aspects of posting mail that are out of the artist’s control. Thus, there is potential here to use the mail to subvert the mail by working within these confines and stretching them.
                <br>
                <br>
                (1) What other unconventional systems of communication have been used in the past and may be used in the future for the distribution of art?
                <br>
                (2) How can mail art be used to combat the Monster threat that Big Tech increasingly poses to our everyday lives?

            <h2>Week 3</h2>
            <p>
                <span>I</span> really enjoyed reading these selections from The Creative Independent and Are.na because I used to be very intimidated by the idea of web design, the internet, and the “cloud.” I remember wanting to take a web design course in high school and clamming up at the mention of coding and HTML. However, these excerpts have opened my eyes to the many different functions a website can and should serve. I was particularly intrigued by how Laurel Schwulst compares a website to a room, shelf, plant, garden, puddle, and even a rock falling into the ocean. Evidently, a website does not have to be linear and straightforward; users are just programmed to believe that by big tech corporations and how their websites are traditionally constructed. Édouard U similarly commentates on this false assumption of linearity in relation to co-reading. Ultimately, these sources of information are what we make of them!
                <br>
                <br>
                (1) How can web designers reconstruct social media platforms to serve users’ actual needs?
                <br>
                (2) How can co-reading translate to using the internet in a different way, and what other conventions can users break?

            <p>
                <span>O</span>lia Lialina’s “Still There: Ruins and Templates of Geocities” delves into the history and future implications of Geocities, a web hosting service that enabled users to create personal web pages in the 1990s. What particularly struck me about the attempted erasure and recovery of these websites were the comparisons Lialina made between the 1.2 million preserved accounts and real life ruins. These profiles, in various stages of completion, construction, and relocation, represent years of internet architecture, design trends, and online communities. Just as archaeologists study material city ruins for a glimpse into the past, archivists glean information from online city ruins. Notably, the erasure of Geocities and the impact of that erasure on other websites indicates the expansive influence Geocities had, even if it was not as appreciated at the time.

                <br>
                (1) How do you think future generations might interpret today’s various online practices (ex. memes, social media, short-form content, PowerPoint nights)?
                <br>
                (2) How do you present yourself online, and how has that presentation differed over time and across platforms?

            <h2>Week 5</h2>
            <p>
                <span>D</span>avid Reinfurt’s A *New* Program for Graphic Design delves into the experimentation behind Gestalt principles, or the “rules” that explain how the mind perceives movement and grouping, as well as some history of graphic design. Although I have studied these principles in numerous classes, it was interesting to learn how they have since been utilized to inform visual languages, particularly in response to advancements in technology. For instance, with perception in mind, Apple had to design a wait cursor to fill a gap in the user experience. I also enjoyed learning the backstory behind Paul Rand’s different corporate logos, inspired by the principles. As both a Consumer Psychology and Design minor, I really appreciate the intersection between psychology and art.
                <br>
                <br>
                (1) Are logos art?
                <br>
                (2) This reading reminded me of the 2008 Pepsi logo redesign. Not really a question, but I think it could be interesting to unpack with this reading in mind, as it was pretty controversial.

            <h2>Week 6</h2>
            <p>
                <span>I</span>n the conclusion of Post-Digital Print: The Mutation of Publishing since 1894, Alessandro Ludovico argues that print and digital are intersecting and combining in unprecedented ways. Digitizing print has new social and political implications for the spread of ideas and activism, while digital increasingly takes inspiration from print for QR codes and “print sampling.” Although I agree that print and digital in tandem represent untapped opportunity, I also think it is important that they can still remain separate. Florian Cramer speaks to this idea in the afterword, recognizing that print has the potential to be “liberating” in itself. At different points in time, print and digital were more or less prevalent than the other. I think there is beauty in seeing both how the mediums can overlap and where they may diverge.
                <br>
                <br>
                (1) When do you prefer print over digital and vice versa?
                <br>
                (2) What examples of mixing print and digital do you find particularly impactful? I personally think Barbara Kruger is adept about purposefully mixing mediums together in her commentaries on consumption.

            <p>
                <span>B</span>ojana Coklyat and Shannon Finnegan’s Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook delves into the role of alt-text, or the written description of an online image, at the intersection of accessibility, art, and translation. I had never considered or encountered alt-text in this light before, as it is not something I personally use in my day-to-day life. What I particularly admire about this reading is its emphasis on balancing function and form. Firstly, it is important to be proactive in accommodating those who need alt-text. Organizations and designers cannot overlook alt-text. Additionally, alt-text should, at its most basic level, serve to include blind and low-vision people in the experience of the image. Accessibility is key. However, there may be some creative liberties in the art realm, as what alt-text includes or ignores can influence the experience. Ultimately, although subjectivity may be inherent, intentional decisions must still be made.

            <h2>Week 9</h2>
            <p>
                <span>I</span>n Ramsey Nasser’s “A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures,” Nasser discusses the visible and invisible biases inherent in computers, programming languages, and translation. As someone with extremely limited knowledge of and experience with computer programming, I have wondered how different coding and markup languages could possibly be standardized and translated across machines. Evidently, this process is even more problematic than I once thought. Not only is there a lack of diversity in production, but diversity alone is not enough to alleviate how deeply rooted Latin text and English are in these systems. Furthermore, these systems are not very receptive to change. Overall, this reading left me feeling pretty hopeless about the prospect of diversifying the programming experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                (1) Is there anything everyday consumers can do to help build a lingua franca?
                <br>
                (2) What other barriers to computer programming exist that could be addressed (ex. disability)?

            <h2>Week 10</h2>
            <p>
                <span>I</span>n Ben Duvall’s “Intro: Surfaces and Signs” and “The Hyperlinked Sign” in New Modernism(s), Duvall delves into the concept and history of semiotics, referencing the pivotal roles the Internet and Mickey Mouse have played in the cultural zeitgeist over time. This reading was interesting to me for three reasons. Firstly, from a design perspective, I found the visual representations of the different relationships between signifier and signified for modernism, postmodernism, and hypermodernism helpful in better understanding semiotics. Additionally, I have learned about Walter Benjamin and his philosophy on reproductions in my communication classes, which enabled me to make connections to prior knowledge. Finally, I have considered Mickey Mouse in the context of marketing and brand imaging before but never in the historical context of Nazi resistance. Overall, this reading effectively combined design, communication, and marketing perspectives, providing a holistic view of signs and signifiers that people may overlook.

                (1) What other important signs in history have been appropriated for different uses?

            <h2>Week 12</h2>
            <p>
                <span>I</span>n Dot Tuer’s “Beyond the New Media Frame: The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games,” Tuer analyzes Frenkel’s Cat’s Cradle teleconferencing performance piece in the context of the digital world. Through livestreams, monitors, and improvisation, String Games is rooted in a sense of time and ephemerality. I myself have actually played large-scale versions of this game before at summer camps, with the goal of learning patience and how to work in a team. However, what particularly struck me about this reading is how the artwork did not receive acclaim until Frenkel translated it into digital formats, namely DVDs and digital prints. In order to achieve recognition, Frenkel had to adapt to the digital world and “technological affirmations of presence” (44). This made me wonder: what is lost in the documentation of something created with the opposite intention? I was also intrigued by the concept that “the past only arrives when the future has been built to contain it” (49), specifically as it pertains to the role artists may play in bridging the past, present, and future.

                <br>
                (1) How does this reading relate to Walter Benjamin’s discussion on reproductions?

            <h2>Week 13</h2>
            <p>
                <span>I</span>n Paul Soulellis’ talk “Performing the Feed,” Soulellis implores listeners to question and critique the flow of the feeds we encounter in our day-to-day lives. Soulellis first defines the feed in terms of its main component: the post. Soulellis posits that posting is about making something public, interrupting the linearity of time to impart some information. I was particularly intrigued by how Soulellis describes the transition from posts to feeds, from purposeful interruptions to near-constant streams of noise. The networked age has turned us into a part of the feed. Whether live streaming or using smart home devices, we are being surveilled for any novel changes, any meaningful information we can provide. Overall, Soulellis proposes that we find ways to interrupt the feed–and thus, our roles in it.

            <p>
                <span>I</span>n Neta Bomani and Sabii Borno’s zine Beyond Dark Matter, protagonist Gem is a young student who gets teleported inside her computer as a result of a malicious software update, “The Way.” Through this experience, Gem uncovers the dark side of computers and its algorithms and learns how to use technology in an intentional, productive way. I enjoyed the format of this message, like a graphic novel, to explain introductory computer concepts to beginners. I also appreciated how the message is not to discredit technology entirely but instead to leverage its affordances while critically examining its history. I think there is potential for including more key terms, but the simplicity also helps make the overarching theme clear.
                <br>
                <br>
                (1) What other key terms could be included?

            <h2>Week 15</h2>
            <p>
                <span>I</span>n Boris Groys’ “Art on the Internet,” Groys discusses how the internet has changed the intention behind, role of, and documentation surrounding art. While I was reading this chapter, the word “immersion” kept coming to mind. Groys argues that art has historically been considered fiction, meaning that, through the consumption of theatre, literature, or a painting, for instance, the viewer is transported from reality into the work of art. Conversely, Groys argues that the internet is nonfictional, rooted in reality. I agree that the internet encompasses more information than an art museum might, such as serving as a general search engine or economic hub of transactions. However, to push back against the proposed binary between fictional and nonfictional, I disagree that one is more “real” than the other. Rather, I think that art before the internet immerses viewers in the world of the artist’s making, whereas art on the internet immerses viewers in the artist themself. There remains some form of transportation from reality, but the context shifts—which then ties into Groys’ argument that the internet has globalized the author.
