            <br>
            I have officially touched down in London town! The weather is certainly as dreary as everyone warns, but I also get the sense that there is something else in the air. Perhaps it is all the Harry Potter content I have consumed, but I feel almost nostalgic here. I explored Notting Hill yesterday and then took the tube to Borough Market and to see Tower Bridge lit up at night. I can't wait to discover what else London has in store for me!
            <br>
            <br>
            Love,
            <br>
            Grace
